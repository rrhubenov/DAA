THIS IS AN INFORMAL ANALYSIS

The whole algorithm is one for/while loop.
To prove it's correct we'll use a loop invariant.

Pseudo code:

for i in 1 to A.len:
    if A[i] equals search_target
        return i
return NIL

Our loop invariant will be A[1..i)
It has the property that it DOES NOT contain v.

1. Initialization:
Before the first iteration our loop invariant is the empty set A[1..1)
The empty set does not contain v trivially.

2. Maintenance:
Let's assume the invariant is true at the start of the loop.
If A[i] is equal to v we have termination else the loop ends and the next
loop begins => our loop invariant holds ture.

3. Termination:
The loop may end for two reasons:
    - A[i] == v and v is returned
    - i == A.length + 1 thus NIL is returned
In both cases Linear search ends as expected.
